// There are an additional 56 intrinsics which do not yet have a unit
// test implementation and, therefore, should not be considered fully 
// verified at this time.  These will be implemented as soon as possible.
// Note: The way unit tests are implemented is that 10,000 random floating point
// and integer vec4 numbers are generated as sample data.
//
// A short C implementation of every intrinsic is implemented and compared to the
// actual expected results from the corresponding SSE intrinsic against all of the
// 10,000 randomized input vectors.  
// When running on ARM, then the results are compared to the NEON approximate version.
